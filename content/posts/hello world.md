Hi, my name is Claire, and I decided to make this blog because the Hugo platform seemed simple, intuitive, and fun. I also want to share the projects I'm working on and the things I'm learning, like algorithms or even ways of dealing with ADHD. 

I love learning, and I find that one of my favorite parts of that learning is word-vomiting the entirety of what I just learned onto an unsuspecting victim. While I know that some enjoy listening to technical rambles, I know this blog will be a better outlet for me as well as a fun place to showcase my work. And those who want to hear what I'm talking about can do so. Consensually.

I also find that when I choose to work on a project, I can get distracted by shiny new project ideas and frameworks I want to try. If I have a blog to write about my projects, it will provide a fun motivator to stick with one project as well as a place for me to debrief myself and package up all my learning in one spot.

I'm planning to dive deeper into web development and possibly app development. I also love video games, so game dev interests me a lot. My projects and tutorials will likely be web dev in the beginning, but we will see where I go!

I hope this blog will help to show myself, my learning, and generally be a hub for my endeavors.
