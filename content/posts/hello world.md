Hi, my name is Claire, and I decided to make this blog because the Hugo platform seemed simple, intuitive, and fun. I also want to share the projects I'm working on and the things I'm learning. 

I love learning, and I find that one of my favorite parts of that learning is word-vomiting the entirety of what I just learned onto an unsuspecting victim. While I know that some enjoy listening to technical rambles, I know this blog will be a better outlet for me as well as a fun place to showcase my work. And those who want to hear what I'm talking about can do so. Consensually.

I'm planning to dive deeper into web development and possibly app development. I also love video games, so game dev interests me a lot. My projects and tutorials will likely be web dev in the beginning, but we will see where I go.

I hope this blog will help to show myself, my projects, and generally be a hub for my endeavors.
