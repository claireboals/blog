# hello world

Created: Feb 22, 2021 2:17 PM

Hi, my name is Claire, and I decided to make this blog because the Hugo platform seemed simple, intuitive, and fun. I also want to share the projects I'm working on and the things I'm learning, like algorithms or even ways of dealing with ADHD. 

I love learning, and I find that one of my favorite parts of that learning is word-vomiting the entirety of what I just learned onto an unsuspecting victim. While I know that some enjoy listening to technical rambles, I know this blog will be a better outlet for me as well as a fun place to showcase my work. And those who want to hear what I'm talking about can do so. Consensually.

I also find that when I choose to work on a project, I can get distracted by shiny new project ideas and frameworks I want to try. If I have a blog to write about my projects, it will provide a fun motivator to stick with one project as well as a place for me to debrief myself and package up all my learning in one spot.

I'm planning to dive deeper into web development and possibly app development. I also love video games, so game dev interests me a lot. My projects and tutorials will likely be web dev in the beginning, but we will see where I go!

Lastly, I am a woman with ADHD, and I did not know I had it until I was well into my CS degree in college. Many of my project ideas usually stem from my needs as someone with ADHD, such as a highly specific type of todo list or a time management automation app. 

I believe, now that I have some techniques under my belt, that ADHD is my superpower. It helps me tap into my passion for technology even more, harnessing my hyper-focus to create really cool things. It also helps me solve programming problems. My brain always needs to be moving, so once I give it a problem to solve, it can knead the problem until the solution emerges.

Of course, ADHD has downsides, and I still have more improvement ahead of me, but I have learned to recognize patterns and work with them. It makes me a better learner and engineer.

I hope this blog will help to show myself, my learning, and generally be a hub for my endeavors.
