I graduated from Tufts University in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I've loved learning for my whole life,
and when I discovered programming in college, I fell in love with its constant learning cycle. 

I've completed many projects in C, C++, and Java. I have also completed web development projects using JavaScript, React, and Node.js. In my own
time, I have dabbled in mobile app development with Flutter as well as game development with Unity. My main interest for the time being is
web development, as you may find by reading some of my blog posts.

My non-programming related hobbies include playing video games, spending time with my pets, singing and playing guitar, and writing. 😊
